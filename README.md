# How do I see that:

I think on the first hand, I'll make it so that you can have an obj file compiled from 6502 binary files, like Ben Eater does when he compiles for the ROM.
The thing is that I hardly see how the stdout, stdin and stderr can be in use in this context.

That's why the NES is a bit more "easy", because it has a purpose. Here I can execute the 6502 but there is nothing "plugged" into it.
